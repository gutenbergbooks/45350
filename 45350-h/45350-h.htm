<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The late Artemus Ward was in the habit of
quoting&mdash;either from his own or another man&rsquo;s store of
wit&mdash;&ldquo;Never prophesy unless you know for certain.&rdquo;
There is, however, a particular mode of foretelling which is neither
dangerous nor venturesome; that process, namely, by which inferences
are being drawn from analogous things that have come to pass, and
applied to the contemplation of future events. The little book here
presented in an English translation may serve as an illustration in
point. It was originally published in the Dutch language, the author
hiding himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e166" href="#xd21e166"
name="xd21e166">vi</a>]</span>behind the <i lang="fr">nom de plume</i>
of Dr. Dioscorides. If success goes for anything&mdash;and who is
prepared to say what it does <i>not</i> go for&mdash;we launch it in
its new form with more than sufficient confidence. Even within the
narrow geographical limits of the Netherlands it has rapidly passed
through three editions, and a German scholar has deemed it not unworthy
of a translation in his native tongue.</p>
<p>The present publication is more and at the same time less than a
translation; <i>more</i>, because it has been prepared for a different
class of readers than it was originally intended for; <i>less</i>,
because in some instances, and at one point especially, we thought we
had some reason to apply the pruning-knife to obnoxious excrescences,
as no doubt they would have proved in a new soil. The foot-notes have
either been added with a view to ensure a perfect understanding on the
part of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e182" href="#xd21e182"
name="xd21e182">vii</a>]</span>reader, or to secure for the little work
as wide a circulation as possible. So far with regard to its form,
object, and origin. There are the boundaries of <i>our</i>
province.</p>

<h2 class="main">ANNO DOMINI 2071.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When comparing the present condition of society with
that of past centuries the question naturally arises, what will the
future be?</p>
<p>Will the same progress which, in our own times especially, has been
of such vast dimensions, and manifested itself in so many directions,
<i>continue to be progressive</i>? And if so&mdash;for who could think
of reaction, since the art of printing has guarded against any furrow
of the human mind being ever effaced&mdash;where is to be the ultimate
goal of the progress of our successors? Where are we to look for the
fruits of those innumerable germs which the present generation is
sowing for the benefit of those that will come after them? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>These, and similar other questions, occupied my mind when, seated
one afternoon in my comfortable arm-chair, I allowed my thoughts freely
to wander amid the manes of those that preceded us. I thought of our
own Musschenbroek, Gravesande, Huyghens, and Stevin, and of what would
be their surprise were they to reappear on this earth, and gaze upon
the marvellous works of modern machinery; I passed in review a Newton
and Galileo, with so many others, founders of an edifice which they
themselves would not now recognise. I thought of steam engines and
electric telegraphs, of railways and steamboats, of mountain tunnels
and suspension bridges, of photography and gasworks, of the amazing
strides lately made by chemistry, of telescopes and microscopes, of
diving bells and a&euml;ronautics; aye, and of a hundred other things,
which, in motley array, wildly crossed my mind, though all
corresponding in this that they loudly proclaimed the vast and enormous
difference between the present and the past. The line <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>of
demarcation between the one and the other revealed itself still more
clearly to me as my thoughts carried me further back into the past and
the ghost of Roger Bacon seemed to rise before my imagination. This
thirteenth-century child was a scholar who surpassed all his
contemporaries in sound judgment and knowledge of natural science;
alas! his fate was the ordinary one in store for all those whose light
shone above that of others in those darkest of ages. He was accused of
witchcraft, and cast into a dungeon, there doomed to sigh for ten weary
years, after which, as the rumour goes, he died in his prison. The
memory of that illustrious man called to my mind some passages of his
writings, from which it will be seen how he, as if endowed with the
seer&rsquo;s gift, did actually foretell, some six hundred years ago,
that which since, and chiefly in our own time, has become an array of
realities. For example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to construct
spying-glasses by which the most distant objects <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>can be drawn
near to us, so that we shall be able to read the most minute writing at
an almost incredible distance, to see all kinds of diminutive objects,
and to make the stars appear wherever we choose.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;We might make waggons that could move along with great
velocity, and without being drawn by <span class="corr" id="xd21e412"
title="Source: animais">animals</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;Similar other machines might be had, as, for example, bridges
without pillars or supports of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&ldquo;There might be contrivances for the purpose of <i>navigation
without navigators</i>, so that the greatest vessels would be handled
by one single man, and at the same time move onward with greater speed
than those with numerous crews.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e426src" href="#xd21e426" name="xd21e426src">1</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>As I pondered over such remarkable observations as those, I sank
into absolute reverie; all surrounding objects seemed gradually to
disappear from my sight, until I got into that peculiar condition in
which, while everything material about us is at rest and passive, the
mind, on the contrary, proves uncommonly active and alert.</p>
<p>I felt myself suddenly in the midst of an immense city; <i>where</i>
I did not know, but about me I saw a vast square, and in it a stately
edifice with a lofty tower, on which I fancied I read the following
inscription:</p>
<p class="xd21e120">A.D. 2071.</p>
<p class="xd21e120"><span class="sc">January 1st.</span></p>
<p>I could scarcely believe my own eyes, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>must have
approached the tower with looks highly expressive of curiosity and
amazement; for an elderly gentleman, accompanied by a young lady,
stepped forward to speak to me. &ldquo;I see, sir, that you are a
stranger in Londinia; if any information could be of service to
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>These kind words caused me to stop; I looked at the man who stood
before me, and was at once struck and impressed by his thoughtful and
noble features. Nor was I slow in recognising him. He was the very man
with whom I had been for some time past engaged in my thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Roger Bacon,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; was his reply; &ldquo;at the same time
allow me the pleasure of introducing you to this young lady friend of
mine, Miss Phantasia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I happened to be in that frame of mind to which one might apply the
Horatian <i>nil mirari.</i> Nothing of what I saw surprised me, not
even the appearance in the flesh of a man like Bacon, who had taken his
departure <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>from our planet some five hundred years ago. I
therefore simply accepted his obliging offer, and began by asking for
an explanation of the figures and words on the tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On yonder tower, over the clock-face?&rdquo; answered he.
&ldquo;Why, that means simply this, that we have arrived at the first
day of the new year 2071.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the time? I see so many hands and figures on the
clock, that I am perfectly bewildered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of time is it you want to know?&rdquo; asked he in
reply; &ldquo;true, mean, or</p>
<div id="s1" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd21e204">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Aleutic Time?</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">for each of these has its own set of hands and
figures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know full well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what <i>true</i> time
is, also what is understood by <i>mean</i> time, but what on earth is
meant by <i>aleutic time</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will soon explain,&rdquo; spoke my obliging guide.
&ldquo;Since the whole globe has been encircled by one large net of
telegraph lines, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>and wire messages,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e495src" href="#xd21e495" name="xd21e495src">2</a> whether east or
westward bound, do the whole round of our planet in a single moment, it
has been found necessary to adopt a kind of time that would apply to
any spot of the earth; for by some such contrivance alone was it
possible to avoid a confusion that would have been fatal in many cases,
more especially in those of commercial transactions, when the knowledge
of the right time is an object of no mean consideration. By mutual
agreement the several nations therefore <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>selected the largest of the
Aleutic islands, by way of a neutral point or centre. When the sun
rises on the east coast of that island, then begins the
<i>world-day</i>. Nor has the selection of the neutral point been in
any way an arbitrary one; for east and west of the meridian which
passes over that island are to be found those very latitudes where the
confusion of time was formerly at its height; and for this reason, that
according to their discovery having been accomplished either from
Europe in easterly direction round Africa, or westward round America,
<i>one</i> whole day had been lost or gained. Now the consequence of
this was, that in the islands of these latitudes the inhabitants of the
eastern coasts and those dwelling in the west differed four-and-twenty
hours in their calculations of time, owing to the circumstance that
they belonged to, or were descended from, the one or the other ancient
colony. The adoption of an Aleutic time has put a stop to any such
confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus endeavoured to satisfy my <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>curiosity, my companion
went on to say: &ldquo;Do come along with us; we shall have plenty of
opportunity to show you other matters of interest in the city of
Londinia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Londinia? Is that the same as London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite; ancient London formed but a small portion of the
present city of Londinia. The latter occupies a considerable part of
the south-east of England, and has a population of something like
twelve millions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we continued our tour, I chanced to hit upon the trivial remark
that we had &ldquo;very mild weather indeed, considering the time of
the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; Bacon said; &ldquo;on the contrary,
it is bitterly cold; only you forget that we are in town. Just feel the
heat of the current of air which rises from the sieve-like plate on
which you are walking, and you will doubtless agree with me that

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>Then look above you. Had the distribution been
insufficient, we should still see the glass roof over our heads covered
with this morning&rsquo;s snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked up, and saw that the street was vaulted over with glass
plates of considerable length and width, joined together by thin bars,
with here and there an aperture as the means of ventilation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I apprehend, then, that we are in a so-called
arcade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; if you mean to apply that name to the greater part
of our city. That which in the nineteenth century was only to be found
<i>occasionally</i> in the great towns of Europe, has become a
<i>regular</i> institution in the twenty-first, owing to the
manufacture of our inexpensive</p>
</div>

<div id="s3" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Verre sans Fin,</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">or &lsquo;Endless Glass,&rsquo; as our people
generally call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt that this must be a considerable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>improvement on your town-life throughout winter;
but in summer-time I should say this must be intolerably
hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; the same society which undertakes the supply of
warm air in winter also provides for us during the summer months a
cooling draught. Nothing can be easier than that. You are doubtless
aware of ice having been manufactured in the middle of summer for at
least a couple of centuries. During the warm season the air is made to
pass over the glass vault above us before it reaches the pavement
through the sieve-like plate, and if the warm-air inspectors properly
attend to their duties, there is scarcely any difference in our
temperature throughout the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then probably you warm your houses by a similar process, and
you never use any stoves or fireplaces now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of my companions could help smiling at these words,
betraying again, as they did, my very old-fashioned notions. Bacon,
however, gave me a kindly nod of assent as he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>proceeded to explain: &ldquo;Just as a cold-water
bath may be heated at pleasure by opening the hot-water tap, we can
warm the air in our apartments by means of a valve, which when opened,
not only affords a supply of warm air, but has the additional advantage
of producing a most delightful refreshing of the atmosphere without any
idea of draught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really cannot understand,&rdquo; Miss Phantasia here
remarked, &ldquo;how the people in those barbarous times managed to
live amid the smoke and ashes and dust of their horrible
fireplaces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then their chimneys on fire,&rdquo; added Bacon;
&ldquo;thank Fate, we have done with that too. Poor insurance offices,
they don&rsquo;t pay half the premium now of what they used to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more question,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;before we leave this
subject. What do you call the metal used for those elegant little bars
which connect and support the roof of glass above us? Surely they are
not of iron, as they would have been in my time?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered my guide; &ldquo;iron, on account of its
greater specific weight, would have been less suitable here than
aluminium; the latter not only corresponds in weight with the glass
which it supports, but it also withstands the effects of the atmosphere
far better than iron. You will very soon perceive in how many instances
the new metal has superseded the old one, in additional proof of which
I would just mention the fact that the modern antiquarians do not
exclusively now speak of the ages of stone, bronze, and iron, but that
they have formally recognised the</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Age of Aluminium<span class="corr" id="xd21e604"
title="Source: ,">.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The latter commenced or dates from the second half of
the twentieth century, when it was first discovered how to produce
aluminium in large quantities from common clay, old tiles, potsherds,
china, and earthenware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;here, then, we have another
striking example to teach us that discoveries simply arrived at by
purely scientific processes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=
"#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>searched after from the pure motive
of increase of knowledge, may often be ultimately productive of the
greatest practical use. The same metal which for years after
W&ouml;hler&rsquo;s discovery continued to be a curiosity&mdash;so much
so that a few grains of it were preserved among the collections of
chemical preparations&mdash;has now become universally beneficial, nay,
a perfect godsend to those districts where clay, <i>i.e.</i> aluminium
ore, is the only underground wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following up this idea, at the risk of being ridiculed or, perhaps,
reprimanded for my impertinent garrulousness, I continued in the
following strain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of the phosphorus discovered by Brandt and K&uuml;nckel
as early as 1669, yet never getting into common use until the lucifers,
fusees, and &lsquo;flamers&rsquo; made their appearance some two
hundred years afterwards; and of chloroform, now the greatest
alleviation of suffering humanity, although Dumas, when he first
compounded it, did but little dream of its application. Then, again,
when Sir Humphry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>Davy&rsquo;s remarkable experiments taught him the
refrigerating power of metal gas, did this not ultimately lead to the
invention of the safety lamp? and not only has the latter already
preserved thousands of human lives, but, more than that, the principle
of Davy&rsquo;s invention has actually become the basis upon which all
steam-engines are constructed, as well as those by which ice can be
made at any time. With regard to the invention of the art of
photography, how could it have become a reality, a possibility, without
the number of purely scientific discoveries that preceded it; aye,
purely scientific discoveries, such as Porta&rsquo;s so-called
<i>camera obscura</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e623src" href=
"#xd21e623" name="xd21e623src">3</a> (sixteenth century);
Scheele&rsquo;s discovery of the discoloration of chloride of silver by
light, at which he did not arrive until two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>hundred
years afterwards; Courtois&rsquo;s finding of the iodine, 1811; or the
invention of gun cotton, from which Sch&ouml;nbein learned to make
collodion; nor would it be difficult to name several other materials,
all found by regular chemical processes, to fix the photographic
images, and to make them permanent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged by my companion&rsquo;s &ldquo;line of
non-intervention,&rdquo; I ventured to continue to speak my thoughts
aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any art more than another,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is
calculated to illustrate the fact that the most important
discoveries&mdash;such as have been most universally brought to bear
upon the joint social condition of mankind&mdash;have simply resulted
from the inventions of scientific men who never dreamt of the practical
application of their discoveries; if any such thing exists, surely it
is the telegraph. Could these magic wires have lurked in the mind of
Thales when he found out, now twenty-five centuries ago, that a piece
of amber, when rubbed, attracts light bodies, even although it led him
to discover <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>the very first of those phenomena, the cause of
which must be sought in that mysterious power which now we call
electricity? Did Galvani think of the telegraphic art when he noticed
how the muscles of his frogs contracted under the influence of
electricity?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e640src" href="#xd21e640" name=
"xd21e640src">4</a> or Volta, when, following up Galvani&rsquo;s
experiments, he produced the pile that bears his name? And yet that
was, so to speak, the embryo of those modern batteries of ours whence
proceeds the marvellous action along the wire. Nor is it in any way
presumable that Oerstedt ever thought of the application of his
discovery to telegraphy, when he first noticed that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>magnetic
needle is deflected under the influence of electricity;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e648src" href="#xd21e648" name="xd21e648src">5</a> no
more than Arago, who found that iron becomes magnetic when an electric
current runs along it through a metal wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;none of those men could ever
have foreseen the ultimate beneficial results of these discoveries of
natural truths.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e656src" href=
"#xd21e656" name="xd21e656src">6</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are perfectly right in your remarks,&rdquo; said Bacon,
as I paused. &ldquo;From my own personal knowledge of what has come to
pass <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>in the field of industry during the last two
centuries, I could adduce a good many more examples to show that many
of your nineteenth-century discoveries, which for a long time
afterwards merely bore a purely scientific significance or character,
have now become prolific sources of material benefit to society at
large. Nor does any one now-a-days doubt the importance of pure
science; all governments look upon it as an urgent duty on their part
to promote the same wherever they can; nor is it too anxiously asked
whether it does bear, in every instance, immediate results to benefit
the material condition of society. Moreover, it should not be here
forgotten that every man of judgment and discrimination has long since
learned to see that the furtherance of material advantages as the aim
and end of human endeavours is an idea as narrow in itself as it is
unworthy of rational beings. Surely there exists another and infinitely
higher mainspring of happiness in the enjoyment of gathering such
knowledge as will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21"
name="pb21">21</a>]</span>enable us to perceive the causal connection
between the phenomena of nature, or teach us the history of man and all
his surroundings. The pursuit of material gratification is essentially
a thing which man shares with the brute; but our desire to ennoble that
which is spiritual or immaterial in us&mdash;that is exclusively human;
the gratification of such desire is the genuine
&lsquo;trade-mark&rsquo; of real civilization. So much is the bulk of
modern society already convinced of these truths, that no government
could now-a-days afford to neglect the encouragement of scientific
pursuit, although the utmost discretion be left to the men of science
themselves with regard to the other question: how and in what direction
the extension of knowledge ought to take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you hear nothing more now of what was once termed
&lsquo;official science&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really do not know,&rdquo; said Bacon, &ldquo;what you are
alluding to; but if you use the word &lsquo;official&rsquo; in its
usual acceptation&mdash;meaning that which can no longer be doubted,
since it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>emanated from a responsible government&mdash;then,
my dear sir, you will pardon me the remark that the expression is
anything but felicitous, nay, very shallow indeed. A government may
protect, support, and promote science, but it can never stamp it with
the seal of genuineness. Such seal is held by truth alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat ashamed of my apparently antiquated notions and childish
observations, I walked on in silence until Miss Phantasia all of a
sudden exclaimed: &ldquo;Here we have actually got to the exhibition
of</p>

<h3 class="main">Heliochromes;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">oh, <i>do</i> let us go in. I should very much like to
know whether they come at all up to those enormous golden placards
outside, and whether the highest of the fine arts is here equalled by
reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something spiteful in the remarks of the young lady; and
at my question of what was meant by heliochromes, she again
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>sarcastically replied, &ldquo;Oh! nothing but
photographs in the natural colours of the objects as pencilled by the
sun himself; so, at least, in her extravagant style, says my friend
Realia.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e686src" href="#xd21e686"
name="xd21e686src">7</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed I, &ldquo;the ultimate triumph of the
life-long endeavours of that plucky Frenchman, De Saint-Victor! final
fruits of the <i>prix</i> Tr&eacute;mont awarded him by the French
Academy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bacon looked at me with a smile clearly indicative of his contempt
for my helpless ignorance. But all he said was this: &ldquo;Come
inside, please, and you will have something else to see than those rude
and perishable experiments of Victor of the nineteenth
century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We entered, and I could not trust my eyes. The walls of the building
were covered with innumerable pictures, landscapes, portraits, and
<i>genre</i>-pieces, some of the figures life-size; and all these
pictures were mere photographs, yet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24"
href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>photographs differing as much
from those that I was familiar with as an oil painting does from a
crayon drawing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappy artists! poor arts!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;what
have you come to at last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miss Phantasia appeared to share my delight no more than my
sympathy. &ldquo;Unhappy artists, indeed,&rdquo; was her reply,
&ldquo;if by such honourable name you designate those knights of the
brush whose sole aim and end is the faithful imitation of reality; but
do not say poor arts! They have by no means died out, the worthy
successors of Raphael and Corregio, of Rubens and Rembrandt, of those
whose calling was not to imitate nature, but to idealise it. And that
is the vocation of art. Simple imitation is mere handicraft. And
although the monuments and statues of living persons <i>are</i> now
mechanically taken from photographs, aye, by a common workman who has
no notion of art; yet have we sculptors who are genuine artists,
creators of the ideal.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>I quietly accepted the rebuff, and rejoiced to think that all those
treasures of art of which my country is so proud had not then, after
all, deteriorated in worth; on the other hand, it was to me a matter of
little moment that mediocre talents, incapable of rising above the
imitation of reality, had been compelled to exchange the brush for the
<i>camera obscura</i>; and I had no doubt that their productions would
thereby gain&mdash;in faithfulness.</p>
<p>As we left the exhibition building, I saw a huge waggon without any
horses, but simply governed by one man, in spite of which it seemed to
roll on as easily as possible, and to pull up at pleasure. The waggon
was loaded with all sizes of black-coloured cylinders, resembling casks
or barrels. I was perfectly aware of the numerous successful
experiments made long ago in England and elsewhere with the
construction of steam-engines destined to run, not along iron rails,
but along the ordinary roads. I could not, however, help noticing that
this waggon differed totally from those <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>old locomobiles, inasmuch
as there were no signs of steam about the novelty.</p>
<p>Once more I turned to my amiable guide for an explanation; but
although he immediately prepared to comply with my request, still I am
obliged to confess that not everything was quite clear to me. I imagine
this was partly owing to Bacon&rsquo;s making use of the names of
engines and materials with which I was unfamiliar; but this is about
what I understood him to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as we had abundance of coal, the use of steam was
found to be amply sufficient for the locomotion of all kinds of
engines, waggons, or carriages; but about the beginning of this century
the quantity of coal in the different countries of Europe had decreased
to such an extent that the price of the article became by far too high
for daily and ordinary use. True, the supply of North America was far
from being exhausted; but, of course, the exportation from thence could
not but influence the cost. The same inconvenience further <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>presented itself with such engines where the
locomotive power was produced by continually recurring explosions of a
mixture of light-gas and common atmospheric air, since the cost of
light-gas naturally increased with the decrease of coal, from which it
was principally made. Under these circumstances, recourse was had to
the electro-magnetic machines, which could not be used to advantage so
long as coals were inexpensive; now, however, these were not only able
to compete with the different kinds of steam-engines, but they had this
advantage over the latter, that they were entirely free from the danger
of explosive boilers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless the electro-magnetic power, with all its
improvements, was, and remained, a more expensive one than that
formerly produced through coal, and the consequence of this was a
decrease in the produce of a great many things which had not only grown
into matters of daily necessity, but even into a <i>sine qu&acirc;
non</i> of a progressive and lasting civilization. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then it was, since necessity is the mother of invention, that every
one contrived to devise a new means of locomotion, until, after
innumerable unsuccessful experiments, a power was finally arrived at in
every way practical and satisfactory, whilst inexhaustible in its
sources. It was, namely, this.</p>
<p>From time immemorial people knew the two motive forces of flowing
water and of streaming air, or wind. When the steam-engines came into
use, the latter had gradually superseded the former, partly because
rapidly flowing or falling water is not always procurable, partly also
because the supply of water, as well as its power, depends on the
quantities of rain falling in the higher districts. The latter
inconvenience, the variability of power, made itself still more
strongly felt in the application of the wind. The most absolute
quietness in the air may be followed by tempests so dangerous that the
skipper is obliged to furl his sails, and the miller finds it necessary
to stop his mill, in order to avoid the most disastrous consequences.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>Now, when the mill stops, it becomes a useless
machine; for then the work of the men is stopped, and ultimately their
wages. Much valuable time is lost, and time is known to be money. Add
to this that a steam-engine may be worked unremittingly, so that the
manufacturer can be sure to finish any given work in any stipulated
time, and it must be clear enough why the powers of water and wind got
to be superseded by steam-power, on account of the latter&rsquo;s
superior regularity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile it is impossible to overlook the double fact that
water and wind may be had for nothing, and that steam involves expense.
Moreover, so immense is the quantity of vital or working power of the
water falling down on the surface of our earth, and also of the
atmospheric currents, that the locomotive power of all existing
steam-engines is comparatively trifling by the side of them. One single
great cataract has more working power than all the steam-engines of
Europe together, and one single thunder-storm may produce <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>such
frightful destruction that it would be ridiculous to measure them by
horse-power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As, therefore, steam became more and more expensive, one
naturally looked for means by which, without losing the regularity and
stability of steam-power, one might turn to account the forces of wind
and falling water. The question had really come to this&mdash;how to
regularly distribute over a certain period of time a force or power so
intensely variable. It seemed as if the working-power of water and wind
had to be collected and saved up, so as to have a regular provision of
such forces in case of need. In like manner Nature had saved her
working-power when she caused the forests to grow, from whence resulted
the coal layers. Art had already done the same in preparing gunpowder
and other explosive matters. Why, then, could the experiment not be
tried in analogous form, namely, by temporary imprisonment or detention
of that vital power which appeared to be so inexhaustible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the problem. With regard to its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>solution
I could not well follow the details. All I could learn from Bacon was
this, that the black cylinders on the waggon already referred to bore
the name of</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="s6" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd21e234">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Energeiathecs,</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">force-holders, or energy-preservers; that one of these
set the waggon in motion, whilst the others were to be delivered either
at private houses for domestic purposes of hoisting, raising, or
carrying; or to blacksmiths, turners, and other artisans, who wanted
motive powers not so extensive as regular. Large manufactories used
similar energeiathecs, only of greater power and dimensions. Some of
these (in mountainous districts) collected the power of falling water;
others (situated in the lower districts) utilised the wind.</p>
<p>With regard to the construction, etc., of those cylinders, I could
do nothing more than to form a faint idea. Thus I thought of compressed
air, or some other gas, which, by some strong pressure or other might
have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>turned into a liquid or hard substance retaining
the capability of rendering again its deposit of force on subsequent
explosion. But I merely give this hypothesis for what it is worth.</p>
<p>While Bacon had thus been endeavouring to enlighten me on a subject
which after all I did not profess to understand, we had reached the
aluminium railings of an elegant and lofty edifice, bearing the
inscription,</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="s7" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd21e240">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">National Library.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Naturally enough, I evinced a strong desire to enter,
but Bacon remarked that a visit to such a place would take up a good
deal of valuable time, that might be turned to a much more pleasurable
and profitable account; to which Miss Phantasia added that if the
gentlemen chose to enter that labyrinth of learning, she, for her part,
preferred a walk in the square; the latter, crossed in all directions
by parks and avenues and flower-beds, was moreover crowded with the
most exquisite works of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href=
"#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>ancient and modern sculptors, living
illustrations of her former assertion that genuine works of art had not
quite died out.</p>
<p>As soon as we had arrived at the opposite side of the square, I
fully understood the wisdom of Bacon&rsquo;s remarks. So far as my eyes
reached, I could see a dense cluster of buildings, more resembling a
moderately sized town than a depository of literature. &ldquo;You see,
my friend,&rdquo; Bacon said, &ldquo;it is imperative here to make up
your mind what to see, or else our lady friend will be tired of
waiting. Which branch of human knowledge do you give the preference
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered that I was especially interested in works of natural
science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible to think of visiting the buildings in which all
these are deposited. You will have to restrict yourself
considerably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let us confine ourselves to zoology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much even for the most cursory glance. It would take us
hours to have a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>mere walk through. Select a sub-section of
zoology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we say the literature of entomology?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do either; you must keep to one single order
of insects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, be good enough to select for yourself,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We entered one of the buildings. How I was surprised to see the
crowd of officers and attendants! some anxious to direct and assist the
still greater mass of visitors; others busily engaged in making out
tickets and extracts for those scholars who had not time enough to do
any such manual work themselves. I felt that this was an admirable
school for young students, who were here able not only to gather a
valuable knowledge of books, but also to form themselves into
independent thinkers and writers.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Nineteenth-Century Books.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As I looked round, I saw one of the junior attendants
engaged in gumming the leaves of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>a musty book on sheets of
collodion, so that one side of the leaf remained at least legible. I
remembered that this was the way in which the papyrus scrolls of
Pompeii and Herculaneum were preserved from utter destruction; but how
great was my astonishment to see that the title-page of the musty book
bore the year mark 1860, Amsterdam. &ldquo;So it is with most of the
nineteenth-century books,&rdquo; said Bacon. &ldquo;Owing to the
bleaching properties of chlorine, the paper on which they have been
printed got so thin, and mouldy, and worm-eaten, that we have but few
works of those days now left; and that is really to be regretted, for
many writings of that time were quite worth preserving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must confess that I was sorry to hear this little bit of
information, so distressing to an author of that age; but, of course, I
was silent, and kept on following my guide through rows and rows of
apartments, until we arrived at last at a vast hall, literally crammed
with books from top to bottom. There we paused, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>and
Bacon turned round to address me. &ldquo;Now we are among the
literature of the two-winged insects; what work do you wish to
see?&rdquo; But staring at those thousands of volumes of treatises on
gnats and flies, I was too much afraid again to betray my ignorance; I
felt sure I would hit upon some title or other to convince my guide how
little I was <i>au courant</i> of the twenty-first century. I limited
myself to expressing my gratification at what I had already seen, and
added that I would not trespass any further upon the obliging courtesy
of my friend.</p>
<p>And thus we left the National Library, an institution which they
might safely have called the <i>bibliopolis</i>, for indeed it was like
a <i>city of books</i>.</p>
<p>As we passed once more through the front gate on our return, we came
across a crowd of men who were about to enter, and whom I judged by
their dress and appearance to belong to the class of artizans. I asked
Bacon what business had those people there? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;These are workmen from a neighbouring factory,&rdquo;
answered he; &ldquo;they come here in turns for an hour every day, in
order to read in yonder room, especially set apart for them, such books
as the library committee has judged to be adapted to their wants. Such
workmen&rsquo;s libraries exist in all the several quarters of the
city, but they are most numerous in the densely populated districts
where most factories are to be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are they well frequented? And do employers allow their
workmen to make use of them? And have they reduced their wages in
consequence? Are they not afraid that their men will thus become too
clever, too well educated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to your first two questions&mdash;<i>yes</i>;
with regard to the latter two&mdash;<i>no</i>. So far as employers are
concerned, they have long been taught by experience that, by allowing
their <i>employ&eacute;s</i> one hour&rsquo;s relaxation daily, they
act in their own interest; that is to say, when such an hour&rsquo;s
&ldquo;holiday&rdquo; be turned to good <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>account by the men
themselves, by learning something more about their business, and
contributing to their mental development generally. Besides, what else
could have happened, since the continual invention of new machinery has
done away with so much of our manual labour? Naturally enough, a
greater demand has set in among the working classes for knowledge and
intellectual culture, and this has shown itself in the same proportion
as the demand for mere handicraft has subsided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity, though,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for those who
<i>cannot</i> make use of the library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cannot!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed my guide; &ldquo;but the
doors are open to every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except to those who are unable to read, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unable to read!&rdquo; retorted Bacon; &ldquo;but we are in
Europe, my dear sir, not among the Hottentots or Bushmen! There is not
one man or woman amongst us but what can read and write, and even do
some arithmetic. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>Surely these elements of knowledge are the very
first steps on the field of culture, and the <i lang="la">sine
qu&acirc; non</i> of a person&rsquo;s being a useful member of
society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I then understand from your remarks that you have arrived
at last at a system of</p>

<div id="s9" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd21e252">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Compulsory Education?&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Most decidedly, sir! How could you doubt that
for a moment? If parents are obliged to maintain their children with
food and the &lsquo;necessaries of life,&rsquo; why should they not be
compelled to look after the nurturing of their minds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, because the one is a moral obligation, whereas, if I
rightly understand you, school education has been made compulsory by
the law; and this would appear to me to be an infringement of
individual liberty, and of the rights of parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did understand me rightly, so far as the law is
concerned; but permit me, sir, to point out to you that you have taken
a very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>one-sided view of the question of compulsion. You
will probably admit that for any properly managed society to exist,
every member of the same has to sacrifice a portion of his individual
liberty in the interests of the whole of which he forms part. In many
cases such sacrifices are borne without any reluctance or opposition;
then, namely, when they are visibly and amply compensated by the many
advantages involved in our living in a well-regulated society. With
regard to the much-vaunted rights of parents, it should never be lost
sight of that the children have their rights as well; aye, from the
moment they enter upon this world; and one of these rights is that
they, born in civilized society, where ignorance is excluded as a
foreign element, must be somehow enabled to appropriate some culture to
themselves. If now the parents abuse their rights <i>by sheer force</i>
it becomes the duty of the state to intervene on behalf of the weaker,
and, by legal exactions, protect the children in their future welfare.
This is, at the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41"
name="pb41">41</a>]</span>time, in the interests of the state; for the
experience of preceding centuries, when compulsory education was not
universally recognised, has taught us again and again that the jails of
Europe were mostly filled with those that could neither read nor
write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more question permit me. Has not the introduction of
compulsory education been accompanied by great, almost insuperable
obstacles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That these obstacles were at least not <i>insuperable</i> you
may easily gather from the fact that, even in the nineteenth century,
the compulsory measure existed in some parts of Germany, and met with
no opposition. Of course, on its application to other countries, some
difficulties had at first to be surmounted; for all novelties meet with
opposition somewhere, and all changes are fraught with more or less
evil somehow. At first the measure had to be occasionally enforced by
the arm of the law, but a very few years sufficed for the legal clause
to grow into a popular habit; and the present generation, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>grown up
under its beneficent influence, is so deeply convinced of the
indispensability of some elementary knowledge in every member of
society, that the law might be safely repealed without fear that any
school would lose a single pupil.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e879src" href="#xd21e879" name="xd21e879src">8</a></p>
<p>Bacon&rsquo;s arguments were by no means lost upon me; nay, it
seemed now almost strange and inexplicable to me that in an age when
the word &ldquo;progress&rdquo; proceeded and was re-echoed from lip to
lip, so absolute a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> of progress could have
found opponents. But then I remembered at the same time that the word
progress admitted of more acceptations <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>than one. I was about to
inquire of Bacon in what sense the term was taken in the twenty-first
century, when my eye fell upon another row of buildings far greater in
extent than those constituting the National Library. I was informed by
my guide that we had arrived at the National Museum.
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are preserved some glorious works
of art and all the most remarkable objects of nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I easily understand,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that even the
ordinary tourist would require a couple of days to gratify his morbid
curiosity in this <i>enceinte</i>; but could I not see some small
department at least of all these sightworthy productions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Miss Phantasia, &ldquo;let us see the
collection in the</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">that is my hobby,&rdquo; continued she, as she stopped
before one of the edifices.</p>
<p>Could I trust my ears! A young lady&rsquo;s favourite study was
genealogy; old parchments, coats-of-arms, and heraldry her hobbies!
However, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>I could but follow her, and as I did so, and
arrived at our destination, I saw none of her &ldquo;hobbies&rdquo; at
all; from one single centre, spreading into innumerable directions and
ramifications, I observed a collection of skeletons; several of them
were indeed old acquaintances, such as the elephant, the mammoth, the
mastodont, the rhinoceros, the horse, the hippotherium, the
anchitherium, the palaeotherium, the lophiodon, etc., etc.; but a far
greater number apparently represented the remains of creatures
altogether unknown to me; they were arranged, not only according to
their general dates of discovery, but also on the basis of organic
relationship, so that those forms nearest to each other showed the
nearest approach in outward appearance, whereas the extreme forms on
both sides bore the most astonishing contrast.</p>
<p>It now became clear to me in what sense our fair companion had used
the qualification of genealogical, not as referring to the noble trees
of families but to indicate the various <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>ways by which the animal
species that have at one time lived on this earth had developed one
from the other. Miss Phantasia appeared to attach great value to this
genealogical collection; but still I could not help remarking to her
that this process of exhibiting the fossils of animal species did by no
means prove what it was intended to do; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;up to the present day there are to be found <i>on our globe, and
alive</i>, all sorts of mutually related forms and intermediate
varieties.<span class="corr" id="xd21e915" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; exclaimed the bright-eyed, lively damsel,
&ldquo;you would think differently if you were acquainted with all the
new discoveries of our age.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e920src"

<p>Perfectly agreeing with Miss Phantasia, so far as my ignorance went,
I thought I had better drop the subject altogether; still I ventured to
ask her one more question: Did this museum at the same time contain the
ancestors of the human race? In reply she pointed to a row of veiled
figures in the background of the hall; but as she took my hand to
conduct me thither, Bacon stepped between us, and said, &ldquo;Let not
my fair friend tempt you; you would not be able to see anything in that
dark corner over there; the evening is falling. Go you to your hotel;
we too are homeward bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the evening <i>was</i> falling, but only in the building;
for as soon as we got outside, we found ourselves apparently in broad
daylight. I looked about me for gas-flames and lamp-posts, but I could
discover nothing of the kind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>At last I looked up to the sky, and
then I saw far above the houses a dazzling light, somewhat like the
sun, spreading his rays in all directions, and several more of these
&ldquo;suns&rdquo; at considerable distances from one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you even know the</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Solar Light?&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bacon asked. &ldquo;That surprises me; for as far back
as the second half of the nineteenth century it was used to illuminate
both here and in Paris some of the public edifices. Here it has been
generally introduced for some time past, ever since the streets have
been covered with our endless glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then that light is too brilliant and too white; that
can&rsquo;t be gas-light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor is it. Gas is now only burnt in those isolated districts
where the houses stand far apart from each other, but the central part
of the city is chiefly lighted up by the burning of magnesium, and
sometimes also by electric light, or any of the numerous lights with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>which we are now acquainted. The apparatus,
consisting of mirrors and lenses, to collect the light and to make the
beams parallel, <i>i.e.</i> equal to sunlight, is the same for all
those different kinds of public illumination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather expensive, though,&rdquo; was my sudden reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as expensive as you think,&rdquo; continued Bacon;
&ldquo;especially not in the case of magnesium, for there is an
abundance of magnesium ore in the form of dolemite, etc., from which we
get the metal in a way as inexpensive as that followed in the
preparation of aluminium. To this must be added that the process of
burning this metal yields a hard substance, which, by a suitable
arrangement of the apparatus, can be collected again and re-reduced to
magnesium. Speaking theoretically, a certain quantity of magnesium is a
source of light quite as inexhaustible as the oil-jar of the widow of
Sarepta of which we read in the Book of Kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more I looked about, the more I arrived <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>at the
humiliating conclusion that we of the boasting nineteenth
century&mdash;of which I still felt to be a child&mdash;were really
very much benighted, and I could almost forgive Miss Phantasia for
speaking of the semi-barbarous condition of society in my time.</p>
<p>It seemed as if Bacon read my thoughts by my features; for he
continued as follows: &ldquo;I see that you are desirous of increasing
your acquaintance with the present state of affairs. Well, then, if you
have been able to put up with our company to-day, you had better join
us to-morrow, in our contemplated a&euml;rial voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How I thrilled with inward delight at the prospect of such a tour!
Of course I accepted the kind offer without hesitation, although I
could not help raising a slight point of doubt with regard to the state
of the weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trouble your mind about that,&rdquo; said my
amiable guide; &ldquo;early this morning I was at the meteorological
institute, and I have ascertained that the weather will be fine for a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>fortnight at all events. The reports from the
different meteorological stations are all equally propitious. The sky
will be bright, and the wind favourable; I should be surprised if the
a&euml;ronaut would have any occasion to use the energeiathecs, which,
however, will accompany us as preventatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We parted company, but not until I had made a note of the spot where
it was intended we should meet on the following morning. I hailed one
of the numerous cabs on the stand, and ordered the driver to take me to
my hotel. As I drove on, I was agreeably surprised not to hear anything
of that rattling noise over the pavement, which is alike obnoxious to
the person inside the vehicle, to all the passers-by, and to the
inmates of houses situated in public thoroughfares. I heard nothing,
indeed, but the melodious tinkling of four little bells tied round the
horse&rsquo;s neck, and forming a musical chord. I am sorry to say that
I was not fortunate enough to discover whether this &ldquo;gentle
process&rdquo; was attributable to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>nature of the pavement,
or to certain hoops (not iron ones) round the wheels. Probably it was
the one as much as the other.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Telephon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Arrived at my hotel, I was at once struck with its
extreme quietness, more so as the apartments were all but taken by some
thousands of travellers. The cause of this, however, I soon discovered
on entering the elegant and spacious conversation room. Methought I
heard a kind of music, feeble, yet melodious in the extreme. The sound
approached as near as possible that of the human voice; but still the
quality was altogether different. Besides, no artist, male or female,
was to be seen in the room. The only <span class="corr" id="xd21e988"
title="Source: cue">clue</span> that I could get to the mystery was
through a box of small dimensions; this instrument was placed on a
table right in the centre of the room, and thence the sound appeared to
proceed. Taking the affair to be an ordinary musical-box, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>worked
in the usual way, I gazed with no little contempt and surprise upon the
crowd of serious-looking, enthusiastic men and women who had clustered
round the table. As soon as the music ceased, I ventured to approach
the spectators, at the same time asking one among the crowd for some
information with regard to the musical instrument in which they all
seemed to be so much interested.</p>
<p>Oh the number of pairs of eyes that stared at me, full of amazement,
if not of indignation! At last one of the enthusiasts condescended to
break the silence, &ldquo;What, sir, a musical <i>instrument</i>! where
did you ever know such tones to proceed from a musical
<i>instrument</i>? Surely, sir, as a gentleman you must have heard of
the telephon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now remembered that a machine bearing that name, and answering
that description, had been invented as far back as 1861 by a certain
Reis; also that it was based upon the following law, as discovered and
laid down by Page; namely, that when an electric current passes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>through a wire coiled round an iron bar, and the
current is continually interrupted, there arises a sound or a tone, the
height or depth of which is entirely dependent on the number of
vibrations produced by the interruptions of the current, according to
their succeeding each other with more or less velocity. This recurring
to my mind, I now replied that the telephon was indeed not quite
unfamiliar to me, in proof of which I went back to the history of its
first invention; I also gave a description of Reis&rsquo; little
instrument, by which the sound of the human voice could be transmitted
through very great distances; and finally, I added my surmise or
natural conviction that such an instrument must have been considerably
improved upon in the course of more than two centuries.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1005src" href="#xd21e1005" name=
"xd21e1005src">10</a> I was happy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>to notice the excellent
impression visibly produced by my words; there now arose a tolerably
general murmur of &ldquo;whoever now would have taken the telephon to
be so old an affair?&rdquo; As for me, I was complimented on my
antiquarian knowledge, and, thanks to the amiable disposition of the
visitors towards me, I was not long in discovering what had been going
on. That which every one now was so anxious to explain to me amounted,
in a few words, to this. The North-American papers had of late been
indulging in the most extravagant terms of praise with regard to a lady
singer who, according to the Yankee critics, was possessed of a voice
such as no mortal had ever yet heard of, surpassing in compass and
quality everything that could be imagined; a talent whereby all the
artists of former ages&mdash;if history could be relied on&mdash;ladies
like Catalani, Malibran, Henriette Sonntag, Jenny Lind, or the Pattis,
were really no more in comparison than a cricket to a nightingale.</p>
<p>Of course, as might be imagined, these <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>reports from across the
Atlantic had created an immense stir in the musical world of Londinia.
From all directions the managers of concerts and operas had been
induced to negotiate with this marvellous talent, so that it should no
longer be hidden from the musical inhabitants of Londinia. But, then,
all these reports emanated from the States, the <i>fons et origo</i> of
humbug; and, probably taught by experience, the managers had all
clubbed together, and, at their joint expense, despatched a telegram to
the gifted artist, requesting her to allow her marvellous power to be
tested by means of the telephon. That would, at all events, enable them
to judge of the compass and quality of her voice. To this the lady had
consented, and thereupon the managers had hired one of the
transatlantic telegraph cables, on which the experiment had been
made.</p>
<p>As a clear indication of the compass of the voice, I was shown
sundry slips of black paper on which could be seen numerous curved
white lines; the latter had been traced upon the paper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>by the
phonautographer standing behind the telephon, and were supposed to mark
the musical scales within compass of the lady&rsquo;s voice. An
impression of these slips of paper was to appear, on the following
morning, in the musical journal, <i>Panharmonia</i>, in order that
&ldquo;the eyes of the inhabitants of Londinia might anticipate the
glorious treat in store for the musical ears of the great
metropolis.&rdquo; &ldquo;For,&rdquo; added the editor of the
<i>Panharmonia</i>, &ldquo;all connoisseurs in music know the meaning
of these little waves. Won&rsquo;t they be astonished when they see a
tone like this!&rdquo; Saying this, he pointed with his finger to the
very extreme line where the little curves met as near as possible.</p>
<p>Of course I was longing to examine the construction of the telephon.
I was just about to ask one of the gentlemen present to give me some
explanation on the subject, when there was a general demand for
silence. The American lady was to afford us another treat. This time
she sang an air from Mozart&rsquo;s Don Giovanni, and I was delighted
to find that this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57"
name="pb57">57</a>]</span>masterpiece of the great <i>maestro</i> was
not forgotten even three centuries after the composer&rsquo;s
death.</p>
<p>At the close of her examination, the lady was unanimously declared
worthy to appear before the critical public of Londinia, and she
received what we might term a musical ovation by means of another
telephon working in opposite direction. And here the matter was allowed
to rest, it being left to the different managers to endeavour to engage
her services. All and each of these gentlemen looked as if they were in
possession of some secret or other wherewith to outvie their
competitors. They parted, however, on the best of terms, and I retired
to my room.</p>
<p>The following morning I was down very early, and, having enjoyed my
breakfast, I walked slowly towards the place where I expected to meet
my companions of the preceding day. No guide was required in this
apparently immense labyrinth, for nothing indeed was easier than to
find one&rsquo;s way. All the streets, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>squares, etc., were
namely marked, not by names as formerly, but by a particular set of
figures, which, with the assistance of a map, directed me to any given
spot; all that was required to know was two figures, indicating the
point of destination pretty much as with the latitude and longitude at
sea.</p>
<p>I was still at a considerable distance away from it when I caught
sight of a vast building, on which I read an inscription in gigantic
characters:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="s13" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#xd21e277">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">General Balloon Company.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I had expected to find our starting-point in some open
space, or at least in one of the squares, and was therefore not a
little surprised to see that this building was situated in one of the
most densely populated neighbourhoods. Perhaps, thought I, this is
merely the office where the tickets have to be taken. But when I got
nearer, I perceived that the building differed essentially from other
houses in this respect, that it had an entirely flat roof, which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>contained a kind of conveyance, not unlike a ship,
but the precise outline of which I could not discover, owing to the
glass vault over the street.</p>
<p>Bacon and Miss Phantasia were already on the spot, and after the
customary morning greetings we entered to secure our seats. The first
thing now was to be weighed; for the price of the passage naturally
depended on the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1054" title=
"Source: volumen">volume</span> of our bodily organization. It need not
be said that the young lady came off cheapest. We then passed through a
door into a small parlour, or waiting-room, where we found a few more
passengers. In the centre of the room I noticed a staircase, and up at
the ceiling a kind of trap. Against the walls were several cushioned
seats, as in a first-class railway carriage. After a short time the
whole apartment seemed to move. I heard a gentle rustling along the
walls, as if something were sliding down the paper-hangings. But even
before I had time to think on the subject there was a lowering of the
trap in the ceiling, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href=
"#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>a cheerful greeting of &ldquo;Welcome
a-high, ladies and gentlemen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We got upstairs through the aperture, and found ourselves on the
flat roof of the building, but precisely underneath the air-ship; we
entered, however, the open trap constructed in the latter, for we soon
found out that the weather was bitterly cold. This, unfortunately,
prevented me from becoming more intimately acquainted with the outward
appearance of the balloon, and with its locomotive powers. On the other
hand, ample opportunity was afforded us for examining its internal
arrangements. As soon as we came into what I can but term the
&ldquo;hold&rdquo; of the vessel, Bacon called my attention to a long
narrow cylinder which ran across the whole length of the ship.
&ldquo;Therein lies,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the whole secret of
a&euml;ronautics. In order that I may explain this to you, I must
remind you of this, that it was formerly impossible to steer any
balloon except before the wind. An ordinary vessel, when the keel cuts
through the water, can sail half or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>quarter-wind, because she moves
in the two intermediate matters of air and water, the latter offering a
greater resistance than the former, and thereby supporting the vessel
in her movements; to which must be added that the resistance operates
in a definite direction, namely, in that of the motion of the ship, so
that by supplying the craft with a rudder or helm one is able to turn
her at pleasure to the right or the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Bacon, &ldquo;this becomes quite a
different matter when a vessel is merely surrounded by air. Driven
onward by the wind, which means carried along by the atmospheric
current, she meets with no resistance, and therefore lacks every point
of support whereby to turn herself. She will always offer the largest
of her sides to the wind, which falls upon it at right angles, just the
same as on a light piece of paper or cloth whirled round by the
wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order, then, to render such balloon voyages possible at
all, it was necessary, in the first place, to afford the machine its
required <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>support, its resistance, and this was accomplished
in the following manner: The long cylinder which runs along the whole
of the ship is a bar of malleable iron, surrounded by a spiral copper
wire which has been coated with an insulating substance. If, now, a
voltaic current is made to pass along that wire, the bar becomes a most
powerful electro-magnet, which, when free in its movements, like the
needle of a compass, adopts a direction from south to north, with a
slight easterly deviation, and also a certain inclination. When driven
out of its natural direction by another power, the needle will
endeavour to resume its original inclination. As, now, the magnet and
the vessel are so joined together as virtually to form but one body,
the balloon, or rather the ship, is in itself a gigantic compass. The
inclination is removed just the same as with the needle of the compass.
One has merely to alter the centre of gravity, and this can be done in
several ways. Thus, all that remains is the direction in the magnetic
meridian. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If, now, the wind blows in the same direction that one wishes
to travel, then the apparatus is not worked; that is to say, no current
is passed through the wire. Should the wind, however, be unpropitious,
then the ship is at once changed into a magnet. For example, suppose
the wind to be due west, and the sails to be placed at right angles
with the wind, then the vessel will be driven neither east nor
northward, but towards a point intermediate; just as a vessel at sea
when pushed north by the current of the water, and westward by the
wind, does not follow either of these directions exclusively, but an
intermediate one. It is not difficult, therefore, to perceive that the
a&euml;ronaut, by the proper joint working of his sails and of the
electro-magnetic apparatus, is enabled to turn his ship into any
direction he chooses. Nor is that all. The apparatus also serves as a
helm or rudder; for as soon as I press this knob the current is at once
reversed; the north pole becomes the south pole, and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>. It stands to reason <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>that the vessel must turn
under the circumstances, and, of course, according to pleasure; for at
any moment the helmsman may interrupt the current, whereby the ship
ceases to be a magnet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, as indeed at sea, the case may be that the wind is too
strong, and the power of the magnet insufficient to properly govern the
air-ship. In that case we have recourse to those energeiathecs of which
I spoke yesterday; these tend to set in circular motion the four-winged
screws which you see here and there peeping out of the sides, and this
is always done as near as possible at right angles with the direction
in which the vessel has a tendency to deviate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus it is usually possible to keep the ship in the direction
required; but should the a&euml;ronaut fail in his attempt to do so,
even then he has another resource left him which the seaman lacks. He
rises or descends with his air-ship in search of a more favourable
wind; nor does he do so at hap-hazard, for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>the
meteorological institute has long since issued charts upon which are
marked the directions of all the air-currents that will probably be
found at any given altitude for any given time. These charts are
arranged in the same manner as those formerly published by the
institute, which, however, merely showed the probable direction of the
wind in the immediate vicinity of the earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to the modes of ascent and descent, they differ
somewhat according to the nature of the various apparatuses, and for
these, to explain them to you in detail&mdash;by which alone you would
understand the differences&mdash;we should have to go on deck, and it
is so bitterly cold there, that we are better where we are. Suffice it
to say that the old clumsy process of throwing out ballast for the
purpose of rising has long been dispensed with, since it was found that
the measure was merely a partial or momentary one, and slightly
unacceptable to the denizens of the earth below. The most appropriate
method <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>we have learned from nature; it consists, namely,
of an imitation of the operation of the swim-bladder in fishes. The
latter accomplish their ascent and descent in the water by a greater or
lesser compression of that bladder, or of the air contained in it; some
of them having even special compression apparatuses for that object.
From this you will easily conclude the application of the aquatic
locomotion to that of the navigation in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, I must confess, I did not quite see; but many other points in
Bacon&rsquo;s explanation remained to be cleared up. Not a few
questions were on the tip of my tongue, but I asked no more. I felt
that I was a child of the nineteenth century, too little <i>au
courant</i> of the science of modern times to understand all that had
been accomplished during the last two hundred years; moreover, I feared
that by putting more silly questions I should lower myself in the
estimation of my friend. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href=

<h3 class="main">Travelling Dialect.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Miss Phantasia was of too mercurial a temperament to
listen to lengthy descriptions; she had already ascended the steps that
led to the saloon, and we now followed her. The compartment looked neat
enough, though not comfortable. Everything pointed to the endeavours of
rendering all the furniture as light as possible, and this, of course,
applied to the whole affair whenever it did not interfere with the
necessary solidity. Bamboo canes cut thin and twisted together appeared
to be the chief material, and of the metals aluminium was the only one
to be seen.</p>
<p>On our entering the waiting-room, I had already noticed that all the
passengers conversed with one another in the same tongue, in a dialect
of which I certainly recognised a word or two, but yet a foreign idiom
to me. On asking my companion what countrymen those gentlemen were, I
received the following reply: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href=
"#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They belong to all sorts of nations. That burly-looking
gentleman yonder is a Russian; that ridiculous little man playing with
his moustache and ogling all the ladies can only be a Frenchman; the
other trunculant figure, who has paid the highest fare, is one of your
own countrymen&mdash;a Dutchman; those two blue-eyed, flaxen-haired
youngsters are Germans, and all the rest are English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how, then, is it that they all speak the same
language?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They speak the travelling dialect. In our modern days, when
many people spend the greater portion of their time in travelling, and
all nationalities continually mingle together, such an idiom was
created almost spontaneously. True, it is as yet but a language in its
infancy; but it will probably, at no great distance of time, become the
universal tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened as attentively as I dared and could, and I observed very
soon that the so-called travelling dialect was a mixture of various
tongues, English though preponderating; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>and this I ascribed to
the fact of the majority of the travelling public being generally
Englishmen.</p>

<h3 class="main">No more War!</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As I looked about me, it so happened that my eye fell
upon some wide tubes peeping out from the sides and the hold of the
vessel. I first thought that these were a new kind of cannon; so I
asked whether we were on board of a man-of-war? Miss Phantasia smiled,
but her smile was a bitter one immediately followed by a sigh.
&ldquo;War!&rdquo; she echoed, &ldquo;those chivalrous times we only
know from history; our modern men are manufacturers, merchants,
engineers, scholars, legislators, and so forth; but as for
soldiers&mdash;well, you may see them on the stage occasionally, but
our numerous force of constables is the only approach to soldiery we
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; cried I; &ldquo;no more war, and no
more standing armies! At last then the idea has triumphed of the
peace-men, Cobden, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70"
name="pb70">70</a>]</span>Bright, and their followers; at last the
present generation has acknowledged that war was an eternal disgrace to
humanity, reducing reasoning men to the level of the unreasoning brute,
and causing them to destroy each other&rsquo;s lives in the blindest
fury, instead, alas! of dwelling together on this beautiful earth in
unity, peace, and concord, for the promotion of mutual
happiness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt very much indeed,&rdquo; muttered Bacon in his teeth,
&ldquo;whether any such considerations as those have brought about the
reign of peace. Mankind, my dear sir, is still swayed by passion; quite
as much, I venture to say, as in bygone days. Men still deserve the
epithet once served upon them by a foreign poet: &lsquo;angel half,
half brute!&rsquo; and so it will be in the future, although it can
never be denied that society, as a whole, progresses in a moral sense.
But for this, that &lsquo;circumstances alter cases,&rsquo; I am afraid
there would be war still. Only circumstances <i>are</i> altered, and
war has become an impossibility. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"
href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, our present condition of peace has been
chiefly brought about by the universal state-bankruptcy at the close of
the nineteenth century, when the combined debts of the would-be
civilised nations (in consequence of the immense expense involved in
the large standing armies) had become to surpass the joint national
capitals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second place, the present state of affairs is due to
the marvellous improvements lately made in the weapons of attack and
defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, in the last war, now about a century ago, the navies of
England, France, Russia, and America had mutually destroyed one
another; when, through a bombardment from both sides of the channel,
the capitals of England and France had simultaneously been set on fire;
when the losses on both sides had become incalculable, not to say
irreparable, then, but not until then, people began to ask themselves
whether even a victory was worth such enormous sacrifices. And it
finally dawned in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72"
name="pb72">72</a>]</span>public mind that <i>in all wars the conqueror
is likewise the loser</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that which has mainly contributed to render war gradually
a matter of rare occurrence, and which, we trust, will ultimately lead
to its complete abolition, is the vastly increased intercourse between
the peoples of various nationalities, by which all those silly
inherited national antipathies have slowly become absorbed; then again,
we have had the application of the principles of free trade, the
removal of all those barriers that separated nations from nations, an
universal system of coinage and weights and measures, an increase in
the means of locomotion and communication, and the fusion of the
individual interests of particular nations into one great universal
&lsquo;public weal.&rsquo; Nations have ceased to stand opposite,
against one another, they flourish side by side; by thousands and
thousands of bonds they are joined and held together; and if the
nineteenth century has witnessed the introduction of the principle of
nationality, ours has made another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73"
href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>step in the right direction, and
produced the recognition of the principle of humanism.&rdquo;<a class=

<p class="first">I was much impressed with the justness of the last
words of my companion. It now became clear to me how every new
railroad, every new telegraph line, the removal of every obstacle in
the process of exportation and importation, does not only directly
promote the general interest and welfare, but that they are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>as many links in the great chain by which men are
united together in brotherhood as members of one and the same
household. And yet methought I perceived a threatening cloud at this
bright horizon. &ldquo;If then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;all wars have
ceased to be, and if in consequence thereof, as well as through other
propitious circumstances of various kinds, commerce and industry have
been constantly progressing, surely you must have witnessed an alarming
increase of population; and the production of the necessary food can
hardly have kept pace with its consumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you suppose that we have now, as formerly, many indigent
people and others occasionally starving in some of the over-peopled
districts, then, of course, you are right; but I do not grant that, on
the whole, pauperism has been on the increase; I am rather inclined to
believe the contrary, although during the last two hundred years the
population of Europe has almost doubled itself. Two things you should
not lose sight of; in the first place, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>the increase in the means
of transport having brought about a more equal distribution of food;
and secondly, of nothing now-a-days being wasted, but, on the contrary,
everything finding its way to where necessity exists. In consequence of
a now universal free trade, every country produces exactly that which
thrives best in its own soil and climate. Then, again, numberless acres
of waste land have long been, and are still being, cultivated; whilst
progressive science has rendered imperishable services to the practical
agriculturist by pointing out to him various new modes and processes
whereby to increase the crops and fruits of his fields. Thus, for
example, we know now everything connected with the quality and quantity
of all matters used in the cultivation of vegetables; moreover, every
agriculturist has become, in our days, a manufacturer. To him the
plants are the tools through means of which the so-called
<i>inorganic</i> matter imbedded in the soil and atmosphere is to be
worked and shaped into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span><i>organic</i> matter, <i>i.e.</i>, into
matter fit for consumption; and therefore, as with any other
manufacturer, his efforts are constantly directed towards obtaining the
original <i>rude material</i> as cheap and as good as possible. Among
this &lsquo;rude material&rsquo; not a little is to be found that was
formerly looked upon as mere waste, or, worse than that, mixed with the
water or the soil of the towns, to the great injury of the public
health. We are wiser now in the twenty-first century. Everything by
which the produce of the fields can be increased is carefully
collected, and life is thereby much better protected.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Modern Telescopes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I had already noticed, during the conversation, that
our a&euml;rial conveyance had assumed a gentle swinging position; and
when Bacon paused in his remarks, Miss Phantasia cried to me,
&ldquo;Do, now, apply your eye to these pseudo-cannons, and tell us,
pray, where we are.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=
"#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>I found at once that those tubes which I had mistaken for cannons
were enormous telescopes; but my mistake was pardonable enough, so far
as their outward appearance went. They were certainly much wider, from
which I concluded, <i>&agrave; priori</i>, that they must be powerful
machines; but when I came to look through them, I discovered that their
great width did in no way interfere with the sharp outlines of the
images, and I was not only very much struck with their immense
magnifying power, but at the same time with their great extent of the
field of vision.</p>
<p>Following Miss Phantasia&rsquo;s finger direction, the first thing I
saw before me through the telescope at the stern of the vessel was an
immense city, which I fancied could be no other than Londinia, from
whence we had started. A vast cluster or mass of houses presented
itself, with the sharpest outline, in the somewhat dull background, but
no idea of smoke; I therefore concluded that wherever coals were still
used, one knew how to pass <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href=
"#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>the smoke through the cowl or
fire-grate in accordance with the wise Act of Parliament passed in
1850.</p>
<p>As I looked through the different telescopes which we had on board,
I could not help admiring the scenery around and about us, which seemed
to rush and rush on before our eyes whilst the ship was apparently
lying still. Ascending, it was as if the earth went down beneath us.
Shortly after, we caught the first glance of the sea, and right before
us, opposite, we perceived the Belgian and French coasts. A black wire
seemed to cross the narrowest strait of the Channel, so as to join the
two opposite shores together.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As we came nearer I began to suspect that this wire
might be a tubular bridge of some kind, and this surmise grew into
certainty when Bacon assured me that a company had already been formed
for the purpose of constructing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"

<h3 class="main">North Holland Submerged.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A slight north-north-easterly direction, and a few
minutes sufficed to bring us near to my native home, which to us, from
our vessel, looked like its outline in an atlas. Only how terrified I
was to see that there was something wanting on the map. The whole
province of North Holland,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1204src" href=
"#xd21e1204" name="xd21e1204src">12</a> <i>minus</i> a few diminutive
islands, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>seemed to have disappeared. Not even trusting my
eyes, I asked the &ldquo;trunculant figure&rdquo; who, Bacon said, was
my countryman: Was the whole of North Holland imbedded in the sea?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
result of not heeding the advice of common-sense, prudent people. A
handful of bragging citizens of Amsterdam insisted upon it, that they
should have a canal right across into the sea. They had one already, in
which they might have made some improvements, but that would not
satisfy them. Well, after a good deal of agitation, they got their
canal. How much it may have cost them I do not pretend to know; no
doubt a good deal more than many of them must have liked. However, now
that they had it, it proved, after all, &lsquo;a fair-weather
Jack;&rsquo; for as soon as the wind lost <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>its temper&mdash;and such
things <i>do</i> happen along our coast&mdash;the skippers did not
venture to come too near to the shore. At the first November storm the
harbour became full of sand, to clear which would have been to wash the
negro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus the canal had had little power to benefit navigation.
Still, matters did not come to the worst until, in 1980, the springtide
fell in simultaneously with a storm such as the memory of living man
could not trace. Sluices and dykes gave way, and North Holland, the
greater portion of which was situated from one to five meters<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1232src" href="#xd21e1232" name=
"xd21e1232src">13</a> below the mean level of the sea, was rapidly
swallowed up by the raging element. Shortly after the play-going public
of Rotterdam enjoyed a new drama, entitled &lsquo;The Horse of
Troy.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1238src" href=
"#xd21e1238" name="xd21e1238src">14</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible, terrible!&rdquo; I could not refrain from
exclaiming, although the man who supplied me with the
&ldquo;terrible&rdquo; information did not appear to see it. I had
already inferred from the latter part of his remarks that he was a
native of Rotterdam, and this suggested to me the idea of once more
looking through the telescope, and turning my looks towards the city
where I had passed the earlier part of my youth. At first I did not
feel at home at all. So much had the city of the Meuse enlarged itself
into every direction, and so densely populated was the whole province
of South Holland, that the towns of Leiden, the Hague, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>Delft,
Schiedam, and Rotterdam seemed to form but one large city.</p>
<p>Utrecht, too, appeared to have grown in extent. My eye fell
accidentally on a bright dazzling spot, lighted up by the rays of
Ph&oelig;bus; and, anxious to find out what that was, I applied a
stronger &ldquo;oculaire&rdquo; to the telescope, and soon recognised
the golden sun of Justice, the well-known armorial bearings of the
Utrecht University, on the top of a large and magnificent building. I
thought that must be the University building, and inquired of the
&ldquo;trunculant figure;&rdquo; but the latter answered curtly,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s entirely out of my line, sir; those are things with
which I have nothing to do.&rdquo; Fortunately for me, Bacon had heard
my question, and he at once supplied me with the necessary information.
&ldquo;You have guessed rightly,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;when, after
many years&rsquo; waiting, there came at last a bill regulating the
higher education in the Netherlands, some wealthy inhabitants of the
city of Utrecht, at their own expense, founded this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>magnificent and imposing building, and by so doing
furnished a living illustration of their interest in science, and of
their affection for the <i>alma mater</i> to which many of them owed
their education and social position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking Bacon for this valuable piece of information, I further
ventured to inquire whether in the new educational bill the principle
had been recognised &ldquo;that it is a matter of perfect indifference
where any candidate had obtained the knowledge required by the law, and
that the state had no other right but to demand this of the candidate,
that he satisfy the government examiners with regard to his
abilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are doubtless touching a knotty point,&rdquo;
answered my companion; &ldquo;for this has been a matter of discussion
for some time; and, strange to say, those that have given the most
definite opinions on it are exactly those that were least competent to
judge in the matter of public examinations. At first sight the
principle you have laid down certainly appears <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>reasonable enough. Those who, with you, appear to
have accepted it, argue mathematically as follows: Given a certain
quantity of linseed, then by the same press, and with the same amount
of pressure, it will yield a certain amount of oil, and the latter will
consequently indicate the exact relative value of the different kinds
of linseed. It all amounts to this, to find a good press, one in
regular working order. It is not otherwise with public examinations.
These, too, are a kind of press, under which are to be brought the
persons to be examined, and out of them are to be squeezed a dose of
knowledge prescribed as the <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> of their
admission. It only requires to have a good examination press, and the
results will always admit of comparison; that is to say, they will be
just and fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here a curious difficulty had to be surmounted. It is
easy enough to construct presses from iron or wood that will work
regularly; but with examination presses that is altogether a different
affair. Especially with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>regard to those for the higher
branches of education the matter is not so easily procurable. And then
there is another thing; neither are the examiners composed of wood and
iron, nor are the students that have to be examined usually made of
linseed; both classes of persons are more likely to be rational beings;
the contract between them entails action and reaction, with
thousandfold variations, so that there can never be any question of
absolutely comparable results, least of all when the examiners and the
examined are more or less strangers to each other. Leaving out other
difficulties, there would still remain the very natural resistance
which such heterogeneous elements would exercise towards each other, a
resistance which will always be commensurate with the greater or lesser
difference of interests in the parties concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order now to overcome this difficulty, and to save the
principle that &ldquo;those aspiring to equal rights should satisfy
equal conditions,&rdquo; the Government issued certain text-books in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>the form of examination guides. And what was the
consequence? Industrious persons arose, and contrived to invent means
by which to make those works essentially practical, and the
examinations as light as possible; they composed little books
containing questions and answers, something like catechisms, for every
branch of science. This appeared to some people to be the height of
examinatorial equality; but when, in spite of all this, the same
complaints continued to be heard about the unfairness and arbitrary
ways of examiners, the still more novel idea was mooted, whether it was
not possible to solve the examination problem by a direct method, viz.,
physico-mechanically. For a long time past we had had speculums for the
eye, for the ear, for the throat, etc.; why should we not succeed in
inventing a speculum for the brain? There were already self-registering
thermometers, barometers, magnetometers, photometers, etc.; why should
we not have the self-registering enkephalometer? machines which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>in a few minutes, and by means of a few figures,
would indicate the exact degree and amount of knowledge acquired by the
individual to whose cerebrum the instrument might be applied! What a
splendid invention, both for examiners and candidates, this would have
been! Unfortunately the thing always proved impracticable; and the idea
now ranks with the visions of perpetual motion and squaring of the
circle.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Meanwhile those exaggerated systems of
examination had led to some experience, beneficial, though rather
unpleasant. It gradually became to be noticed by competent persons
that, in proportion as the students prepared for the required and
enforced government examinations, there grew a dislike or decline of
free study, an aversion to pure science, which is more dependent upon
clear judgment than practised memory. And thus was lost the principal
aim of all higher instruction which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89"
href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>is not the
&lsquo;training&rsquo; for certain professions, but the complete and
entire development of all the slumbering faculties of man.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1284src" href="#xd21e1284" name=
"xd21e1284src">15</a> The Dutch people began to see that they had been
following the example of the Chinese, who surpass every nation under
the sun in the length of their examinations; indeed, they found that
they had run great risk of becoming the Chinese of Europe. It became
generally recognised that every principle, however good in itself, may
be &lsquo;overdone;&rsquo; that examinations, however difficult to
dispense with altogether, will always remain a sad necessity; and that
it is perfectly chimerical to think of government examinations so
arranged as to not only produce an universal and incontestable standard
or measure of knowledge, but also to be a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>means of judging the
theoretical and practical abilities of the candidates. It was further
discovered that it was a gross error to suppose that government
examinations were to be the stimulants for university study; in fact,
that what was wanted was not means of discouragement, but of
encouragement. The human mind is like a liquid given to fermentation.
Without leaven there cannot be any fermentation; and the latter is
promoted by heat, depressed by cold. What you want in order to
stimulate higher education in the higher sense of the word is a staff
of competent tutors supplied with ample means for advancing and
furthering knowledge in every possible direction; encouragement for all
efforts to cultivate sound science, and nothing but the most beneficial
results will accrue to society at large. Universities, at the dawn of
their existence, were, as a rule, endowed with certain rights and
privileges, like moral corporations; but these were swept away through
the tide of progress having ceased to be adapted to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>conditions of modern society. One right, let us
say one duty, only remained vested in the universities, that of
conferring degrees on its scholars after the passing of certain
examinations; but the latter were subject, like all other examinations,
to this, that they could never give a sufficiently satisfactory
guarantee. Yet, while the defects of these were largely advertised,
their advantages were often overlooked, until they were ultimately
abolished, or replaced by the examining authority of government
commissions. When at last it was found, after endless experiments, that
people had been jumping from the frying-pan into the fire, one
gradually began to recognise the truth of the French proverb, that
&lsquo;<i>Better</i> is the enemy of <i>good</i>,&rsquo; and one came
back to the old system slightly altered and improved. At the same time
additional means were devised to render access to the universities, as
seats of learning, more easy to deserving men; the fees were
considerably lowered, and distinguished students received henceforth
pecuniary assistance and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=
"#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>support from those who were morally
convinced that in the knowledge which they would acquire they would
repay to society at large both capital and interest. And hence the
number of scholars has so increased lately at your universities, that
there no longer exists the semblance of necessity for admitting others
to the exercise of the learned professions, than those who have enjoyed
academical education. If to this some persons were to reply that such a
restriction of the professional cyclus is rather hard upon those who
have acquired their knowledge elsewhere, independent of the recognised
universities, I would meet them with the counter-remark that the
interests of the individual must give way to those of society at large,
and that there is an intimate connection between the latter and the
continuing prosperity of the universities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked about me to see whether I could discover any more places of
my native land. So far as I could see, the northern and north-eastern
districts had almost doubled their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93"
href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>population, for the towns looked
twice their original size; but what struck me most was that the city of
Arnhem looked apparently deserted. I was the more surprised at this,
because I remembered quite well that about the middle of the nineteenth
century the place had been rapidly increasing, both in extent and
prosperity, owing to the many &ldquo;old residents&rdquo; who, having
returned with colossal fortunes from India, purposed to pass the
remainder of their days in this beautiful neighbourhood.</p>
<p>I must have allowed a suppressed cry of astonishment to escape me on
noticing the crippled state of the city; for the &ldquo;trunculant
figure&rdquo; once more addressed me in the native tongue: &ldquo;Yes,
sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are rightly surprised. From a large
city Arnhem has become a third-rate town. Such things will happen when
children attempt to govern their parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not exactly see the drift of this common-sense remark until my
countryman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=

<p class="first">&ldquo;Once upon a time a gentleman had a beautiful
bird, and the beauty of this beautiful bird was this, that he laid
every year a golden egg. Naturally enough, the man was very much afraid
that this bird should escape, or perhaps be stolen from him. He
therefore first cut its wings, and then put it into a solid cage. When
the children of that gentleman grew up, they gradually became of
opinion that the bird had not been properly treated by their father.
One thought that some portion of the golden egg ought to be used in
ornaments on the cage of the bird. Another hinted that not only should
the cage be embellished, but also enlarged; the bird would then enjoy
more liberty, and might perhaps lay two golden eggs in a twelve-month,
&lsquo;in which case,&rsquo; whispered he, &lsquo;I <i>myself</i> might
come in for a little windfall.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>The third son went
another step further; he would like to see the cage not only enlarged
and gilded, but completely renewed as well; it ought to have much
thinner bars to allow the bird more light and more air; this was its
natural birth-right; for no bird was ever created to drag along its
dreary existence in the dark. Finally, the fourth of the sons went so
far as to say that it was &lsquo;a burning shame&rsquo; to have cut the
bird&rsquo;s wings. That was simply misusing the right of the stronger,
and showed great want of foresight in him that had entrusted his
&lsquo;governor&rsquo; with the bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old gentleman was not a little embarrassed. He was not
blind to the danger of all these juvenile counsels, but he was an
indulgent parent, and never turned a deaf ear upon his children. First
then the cage was gilded, then enlarged, and ultimately replaced by
another, <span class="corr" id="xd21e1325" title=
"Source: bran">brand</span> new, and as light as light could be.
Meanwhile the bird&rsquo;s wings had been daily growing, and the animal
at last <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>managed to do that which every other bird would
have done in its place. It escaped through the thin bars, and flew
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fully understand; the bird&rsquo;s name was
Java?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1332src" href="#xd21e1332"
name="xd21e1332src">16</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; replied the &ldquo;trunculant
figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what became ultimately of the bird?&rdquo; I
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir! it was after all a silly thing for the bird to fly
away; it was not so badly off in its master&rsquo;s house; but birds
will be birds. It had not flown far yet when it was attacked by two
enormous birds of prey; they pulled it right and left with their sharp
talons, and thereby injured one another severely. Of course the weaker
bird lost a good deal of its plumage, and was bandied from the talons
of one vulture into those of the other. At last the two monsters
dropped their prey on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>ground in piteous condition, whilst
they pursued the combat between them with their own weapons, until both
were so crippled and exhausted that there could have been no question
on either side of looking after the weaker bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If then I rightly understand your metaphor, France and
England have both been compelled to let the island slip, and the
Javanese are a free people by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, free, of course; so is the dormouse,&rdquo; answered the
Dutchman.</p>
<p>I suggested that his former remarks appeared to me to be more
liberal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those concerned the land, but not the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Javanese will never change their skin. Those of the
present day are simply a few grades lazier than their progenitors.
Since the last great war Java has been declared a neutral territory;
all nationalities have equal rights to trade on it, and what do you
think <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=

hundred-weights of coffee and sugar which the island continues to
produce, scarcely anything finds its way to our own market; most of it
goes to Marseilles and other parts of the Mediterranean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Bacon interrupted our conservative friend, and spoke
as follows: &ldquo;I am no trader, sir; but unless I am improperly
informed, the Javanese people feel much happier now than when they were
under the rule of the East Indian Company or the Culture System. It
appears to me that possessions <i>which are not colonies proper</i>
impose peculiar obligations on the temporary possessor, and that the
latter is hardly justified in dealing with the inhabitants as the leech
does with the patient. Wherever a superior race holds sway over an
inferior one, it is the duty of the former to raise its inferiors to
any such state of culture as they may prove themselves susceptible of.
From the nature of things, such rule is always temporary, as history
has often <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>taught us. The time must come when the bonds will
be rent asunder; but they will hold so much longer together, and be so
much more easily dissolved, as the government has less borne the
character of oppression. A moral ascendancy is on the whole the most
powerful, and that maintains itself best by fair and just treatment of
the weaker by the stronger. I for one feel perfectly convinced that the
only reason why your country has even kept the island as long as it
has, was exclusively owing to the few necessary reforms which your
government consented to make in the nineteenth century. But for those
concessions, Java would have been lost to you long before; and with
regard to the shifting of the market, don&rsquo;t you think yourself,
sir, that that was chiefly brought about by the Suez Canal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; replied the Hollander, not very
good-naturedly; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t argue the point with <i>you</i>;
you are an Englishman, and you fellows think that you know everything
better than we do; this, however, I maintain, that if this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>kind
of thing is to continue, we shall go down as fast as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I silently rejoiced to think that my telescopical observations had
more than convinced me of this, that my countrymen had by no means so
visibly yet come down, and I was inclined to conclude from this
consoling fact that they had known in time how to apply the old Dutch
proverb: &ldquo;When the tide turns, turn your beacons.&rdquo; However,
I did not venture to set my thoughts to words, for I should certainly
have given offence to the &ldquo;trunculant figure,&rdquo; whose
solitary line of conduct apparently went along his own individual
interests, and whose knowledge of political economy and of the rights
of man was evidently at a very low ebb.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During this somewhat prolonged conversation we had
slightly deviated from our former course. We now moved along in
south-easterly direction, and the native towns gradually disappeared
from my sight. Looking towards <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101"
href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>the east, I observed a small
black speck which obviously moved with great rapidity along the surface
of the earth, and seemed to advance nearer and nearer to us. It became
larger and larger as it approached our conveyance, under which it
finally glided away. I had just had sufficient time to recognise an
immense train of huge waggons in the fleeting meteor below us.
&ldquo;From where,&rdquo; asked I, &ldquo;did this train start?&rdquo;
Bacon consulted his railway guide. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the morning
train,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;which left Pekin the day before
yesterday, and runs along the great central-east-west-line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Pekin? Right across or over the high mountains of
Central Asia and Ural?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my friend, such obstacles have ceased to exist in the
twenty-first century. Surely you yourself remember the piercing of
Mount Cenis? You will soon observe that what was done in your time
between France and Italy has since been accomplished between Italy and
Switzerland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There could be no doubt in the matter; for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>the
white-coated tops of the Alps already appeared at the horizon. The
mountains themselves had not been affected by the hand of time or
civilization, but the route went no longer across the Spl&uuml;gen, the
Simplon, or the Saint Bernard, but underneath the mountain range, so
that the same trains which we saw enter the tunnels on the Swiss side,
made their appearance very shortly afterwards on the Italian side, and
proceeded in their course through the plains of the valley of the
Po.</p>
<p>I was in hopes that we should touch Rome on our way, for I was
anxious to know what had become of that most venerable and ancient of
cities; but I was sadly disappointed in my expectations.</p>

<p class="first">We floated over Venice, where the Italian standard
waved from the top of St. Mark&rsquo;s, although I could recognise a
few Austrian vessels by their immense double eagle. Now ascending, then
again descending, it was often <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103"

where we found ourselves, until I noticed Constantinople; but nowhere
could I descry a single crescent, nor any other emblem that might have
led me to conclude what Government had got possession of the ancient
capital of the Eastern empire.</p>
<p>Crossing the Black Sea, and leaving the Caucasus behind us, we got a
full view of the valley of the Euphrates; but I was again disappointed,
in as far as I did not get anything to see in the shape of Eastern
scenery. All the districts over which we travelled had quite a European
cut about them. Nothing was there to show us that we were on another
continent.</p>
<p>Among the buildings which I could clearly distinguish, one struck me
as being in quite peculiar style. The numerous and large domes would
have led me to suspect that it was a church or a mosque, but for the
side wings and adjacent buildings, which looked like ordinary European
houses, except that they were surrounded by colonnades. This edifice,
or shall <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I asked Bacon did he know what this edifice was
intended for? He looked through the telescope, and replied, &ldquo;Why,
that is the famous observatory of Orumiah. I know it by an illustration
of the building which I have in my library. I have not been there
myself, but it must be well worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did they come to erect a building of such gigantic
dimensions so far beyond the circle of civilization?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply for the sake of saving time,&rdquo; was the answer;
&ldquo;now-a-days only those spots are selected for astronomical
observations where they can be made most conveniently and in the
shortest possible time. In Europe the nights are scarcely ever
sufficiently clear to use our now so powerful glasses to advantage.
There, on the contrary, during several months of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>year
the sky is so bright and transparent that one can even with the naked
eye observe the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus. This had been
known many years ago to the American Stoddard, who even called
Herschel&rsquo;s attention to the fact, but that was not the time for
taking advantage of such excellent opportunities. Not until the
beginning of this century was the foundation-stone to be laid of the
<i>central observatory</i>, as it is called; the glorious building was
erected at the joint expense of all civilised nationalities, the latter
including the Persians themselves, who have long ceased to be behind us
Europeans. I need scarcely assure you that this institution is amply
provided with the most excellent instruments, and that it has a staff
of scientific men second to none for making the necessary
observations.&rdquo;</p>

become of the once so celebrated observatories of Leiden, Greenwich,
the Pulkowa, etc., etc.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They have been changed into <i>calculatoria</i>, as in fact they had
been already for some time past. Among them are distributed the
observations made at the central observatory, and these they have to
work out. At the same time these <i>calculatoria</i> continue to be of
some use to the young astronomer; having there to encounter no end of
difficulties, he may learn the value of the Latin adage, <i>Per ardua
ad astera</i>, and so grow ultimately into a hard-working and accurate
observer.</p>
<p>With regard to the practical results already obtained at the Orumiah

<h3 class="main">Tin Mines in the Moon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I followed the direction of his finger, and saw an
immense &ldquo;poster,&rdquo; on which I recognised at a glance the
well-known lunar district of Tycho; of course I was acquainted with its
ring mountains and the bright silver beams radiating as from a common
centre; these were the words on the placard:</p>
<p class="xd21e120">GREATEST DISCOVERY OF THE AGE!</p>
<p class="xd21e120">INEXHAUSTIBLE TIN MINES IN THE MOON!</p>
<p class="xd21e120">WHOSOEVER MEANS TO GET RICH</p>
<p class="xd21e120">HAD BETTER ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH THE NEWLY
ESTABLISHED</p>
<p class="xd21e120">MOON TIN EXPLORATION COMPANY,<br>
TYCHO.</p>
<p>I had already risen from my seat in order to examine the map, and to
convince myself that the words were actually there. As I turned round,
Bacon must have guessed or gauged the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>degree of my
astonishment; for he addressed me as follows: &ldquo;You apparently do
not believe in this kind of discoveries. Yet there is some truth in the
first part of the announcement; nay, more perhaps than it is intended
to convey; for those tin mines are incontestably inexhaustible, and for
this simple reason, that they will never admit of being explored at
all. Tin mines, however, they are. Careful observations with the great
parabolic reflector provided with a hyperbolic &lsquo;oculaire&rsquo;
and a spectrum analysis system for the reflected rays have abundantly
proved that those brilliant stripes radiating from Tycho are nothing
but metallic tin. You will be less surprised to hear this when you
remember that the moon has neither water nor atmosphere. So it is that
metals which on our earth generally present themselves in an oxydal
condition of some kind or other, on the contrary preserve their glossy
surface on the moon just as with us silver, gold, and
platina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now perfectly remembered that through <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>the
invention of spectrum analysis in the latter half of the nineteenth
century it had indeed become possible to discover metals and several
other elements in the different celestial bodies, and I conceived some
faint idea of the possibility of recognising, with the aid of greatly
improved apparatus, even the chemical character of such small portions
of the lunar surface as for example the Tycho stripes. The only thing
quite inexplicable to me was this, how could there be people left in
the twenty-first century so credulous as to believe in the exploration
of tin mines in the moon by us, the inhabitants of the earth? When I
put this question to Bacon, the following was his reply: &ldquo;My dear
sir, on this point, as on many others, men have not much altered. At
all times there have been dupes, the victims of those that preyed upon
them and of their own cupidity. The originators of this unlimited
liability company know full well that there is no possibility of
getting at the tin mines in the moon; all they want to explore is the
cheque-books of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110"
name="pb110">110</a>]</span>the public at large. In former centuries we
have had the same speculations; at that time in the shape of tin,
copper, and lead mines that existed nowhere except on imaginary maps,
or in the form of landed estates, which on closer examination of the
facts often dwindled down into pigstyes, or in the cultivation of
fertile soil, which turned out to be mere wildernesses; very often a
clever array and combination of figures was resorted to, and people
were often brought to believe that one and one are four, and that two
times two are ten. So it has been, and always will be. Think of the
very old maxim, <i>Mundus vult decipi</i>. All that is required for
such adventurers is an elastic conscience, a good deal of
&ldquo;brass,&rdquo; and a certain knack not to squeeze people&rsquo;s
credulity too much, but to blind the masses by an artificial coating of
truth. In former times&mdash;before science had to dispose of its
enormous resources&mdash;had any one proposed to fetch tin from the
moon, the commonest clown would have looked upon him as an addle-pate;
but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>now-a-days so great is the number of recent
discoveries and inventions, which to the uneducated mind savour almost
of miracles, that many end in believing almost anything, and to my mind
this is not to be wondered at. Start a company for parcel delivery by
electric telegraph, issue a prospectus stuffed with learned twaddle,
and an elaborate quasi-scientific demonstration of your
scheme&mdash;above all, hold out hopes of a wonderful profit&mdash;and
you are sure to find shareholders enough.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Will you then always remain the same, always and for ever,

<h3 class="main">Anti 1&ndash;2 League.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Again I asked my companion for an explanation.
&ldquo;This is simply to call a meeting for the purpose of forming a
league to oppose the <i>one-two men</i>.&rdquo; I was just as wise as
before; but Bacon continued his explanation with his wonted courtesy.
No mean introduction, however, was required to make the affair
intelligible to me. I first gathered then from him that the right of
universal suffrage had long since been entrusted to men and women
alike. At first the privilege had been solely restricted to such
persons as were of age, but since then the very consistent remark had
been made that this restrictive measure was very inconsistent indeed.
Why had the money qualification been abolished? because it was
ostensibly unfair that a man paying taxes to the amount of two pounds
should have a vote, and another paying only &pound;1 19s. 11d. should
be excluded from the poll. If the difference of one penny constituted
no vital distinction, why <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>not still further descend until we
arrived at zero? Now the clear-headed and far-seeing people gradually
learned to perceive that the question of being or not being of age was
in itself a time-qualification, and these pioneers of progress began to
argue as follows: &ldquo;Why, you grant the right of voting, of
influencing for good or for evil the interests of country and town, to
doting old men, and you withhold it from young persons in the vigour of
intellect, merely because the law has deemed proper to call them
&ldquo;infants.&rdquo; You would not scruple to enlist them as
soldiers, and they should have no vote in matters concerning their own
interests. Why should a man at one and twenty be better than he was at
twenty? Was not Pitt England&rsquo;s prime minister on his coming of
age? Is it not the height of folly and absurdity to attempt to
determine by law at what period of life a man will just have sense
enough to be entrusted with the performance of a duty which is the
birth-right of every free-born citizen? Such <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>laws
are arbitrary and obsolete, a logical inconsistency, diametrically
opposed to the grand and fundamental principle of equality before the
law&mdash;aye, and a last remnant of those forms of paternal government
which already in the nineteenth century began to be ridiculed and
condemned; what could be opposed to such conclusive arguments? Some
efforts were made, but those that attempted the struggle were cried
down as unprincipled persons, weather-cocks, etc. A kind of compromise
was arrived at; the period of coming of age was &ldquo;recoiled,&rdquo;
but still nothing yet would satisfy the zealots for the principle of
logical consistency. Once more the date of majority was moved back,
until even the babies were admitted by law to come into their
&ldquo;birth-right.&rdquo; The principle had been saved! the principle!
and that was everything with the agitators. Difficulties there were
involved in the principle no doubt, for some of the newly enfranchised
babies could not walk, and others could not speak, and none could read
or write. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>Under these doleful circumstances the mothers
claimed the right to go to the poll for those youthful interesting
voters, and this exorbitant demand the league proposed to counteract.
One was one, and not two. The most learned mathematicians went out of
their way to prove that either was wrong, and neither was right,
meaning that both were nonsense; but the mothers laughed heartily at
such ironical demonstrations, &ldquo;and,&rdquo; added Bacon,
&ldquo;the female party is by far stronger now than the male
party.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Male and female parties!&rdquo; exclaimed I, in
utter astonishment. &ldquo;Have those then become the two contending
parties in politics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally enough,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Nothing else
could have happened; it is the direct and natural consequence of the
emancipation of women, whereby all rights have been granted them that
were formerly exclusively accorded to men.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>I could not help expressing my surprise at such a result, and added
that I was afraid that it must have materially affected the relation
between the sexes.</p>
<p>A sarcastic smile seemed for once to ruffle the placid features of
Bacon as he laconically answered, &ldquo;Perhaps so.&rdquo; But Miss
Phantasia, who suddenly from a listener became a speaker, made the
following oral affidavit: &ldquo;I will just tell you the truth of the
matter. I for one am heartily tired of the present state of affairs,
and so are many of my sisters. When our mothers and grandmothers first
agitated and ultimately carried these so-called woman&rsquo;s rights,
they certainly knew but half what they were about. Equal rights suppose
equal duties, and equal obligations impose equal burdens. Woman,
demanding as a right that which men had hitherto withheld from her,
forfeited thereby the privileges at one time acceded to her by men. In
the old works of fiction, which to us are the sources whence we draw
the morals of bygone days, the man figures <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>conspicuously as the protector of woman; any man
laying any claim to the title of a gentleman treated a woman with
respect and affability; hers was the place of honour in society; she
was both loved and respected, respected on account of her belonging to
the weaker sex, loved as man&rsquo;s helpmate, not his competitor or
rival. All this has changed now-a-days. We wished to protect ourselves,
and we are less protected than ever. We have not taken our places by
the side of the men, but against them, as they stand opposite us.
Woman&rsquo;s weakness, once her strength, is no longer regarded by
rival man, and now we begin to feel it. That which was formerly given
us freely and willingly has now to be wrenched from our male opponents.
The old feeling of chivalry has given way to the habit of rudeness.
Politeness, though the word is not quite expunged from men&rsquo;s
vocabulary, is seldom extended towards our sex. You must have noticed
how, on going upstairs this morning, the men rudely pushed us aside so
as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>to secure the best seats for themselves. This is
a slight specimen of what happens and is tolerated in
&lsquo;modern&rsquo; society. Opposite man&rsquo;s violence is to be
found woman&rsquo;s cunning, and the ultimate chances of success are
pretty well balanced on both sides; but to whichsoever victory may
fall, it can only be bought at the price of domestic peace and bliss,
and of all those nobler qualities which then only will be properly
developed when both sexes keep within the sphere allotted them by
nature and disposition. Whatever we have gained in direct political
influence we have lost in the indirect influence on the hearts of men,
and it remains to be seen whether the gain has been greater than the
loss. No, Stuart Mill, you who two hundred years ago were the first to
put the dormant idea of female emancipation into the shape of words,
and supported the agitation with all the weight of your name, you may
have been a great philosopher, you may have known every possible thing
about political economy, but you did not understand <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>the
human heart; and with regard to us women, you have played us a very bad
trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Miss Phantasia was earnest in her conviction was evinced by the
unusual warmth with which she had spoken. Yet it appeared to me that
she was a little too hard upon Mill. All that he and his followers
undoubtedly intended to carry was that the right of voting should be
extended to unmarried women, and to those that were possessed of some
property. They could not be blamed for the extremes rushed into by
their junior adherents. But there recurred to my mind the dreadful
qualification scale, which had been lowered and lowered again, and I
began to recognise that, here as elsewhere, all arguments have to give
way before the so-called principles and logical consistency.</p>
<p>During our political conversation we had entirely lost sight of the
Orumiah observatory, nor was I slow in observing that all the
surrounding objects were gradually decreasing in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>size; the barometer too, which depended from the
ceiling of the saloon, had considerably gone down, whence I concluded
that we were ascending rapidly, no doubt for the purpose of seeking a
more propitious current in the higher atmospheric regions. Our ascent
was unfortunately, but naturally, attended with disappointing
circumstances; for all the places over which we travelled became more
and more indistinct to our vision. It was not, however, until after
some considerable time had elapsed that the surface of our planet
became altogether of a greenish-blue colour. No doubt we were passing
over the Indian sea. Of course the scene in the saloon was anything but
lively under the circumstances. Most of the passengers ventured upon
their slumbers, and I observed that with them, as with myself,
respiration began to quicken, owing to the higher air in which we
breathed. The snoring of the &ldquo;trunculant figure&rdquo; was
utterly objectionable, not to say more. Even Miss Phantasia, lively and
excitable as she was, had by this time fallen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>asleep, thereby depriving me of her animated
dialogue with a pretty French lady with whom she had been discussing
her pet subjects&mdash;poetry and the fine arts. Bacon alone seemed
absorbed in the reading of a learned dissertation &ldquo;concerning the
possibility of intercommunication between the various spheres of the
universe by means of optic-telegraphic signals.&rdquo; As for me, I
recapitulated in undisturbed silence all the wonderful things which I
had seen and heard of during the last two days, and I could not help
saying to myself: if two single centuries can bring about such radical
revolutions, what will the work of ages be?</p>

advantage of the atmospheric current which arises between the tropics,
and then extends to the north and south and east successively, but now
we are descending again. See how the barometer is going up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking on Bacon&rsquo;s words, I looked once more through one of
the telescopes, and at some considerable distance I viewed two large
islands barely separated by a very narrow strait.</p>

&ldquo;New Zealand is the Great Britain of the Southern
Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But still she has not anything like a population so wealthy,
powerful, and civilised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still a better one than you would have imagined. Already New
Zealand has several large cities with the same institutions for
education and science and art as are to be found in Europe. She
possesses an important commercial navy, has plenty of ore and coal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>mines, a splendid agriculture, innumerable herds
of cattle, a flourishing industry, and an energetic population, chiefly
of English descent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has become of the Maoris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have utterly disappeared, no one really knows where to.
According to some New Zealand naturalists, they have died out; others
imagine that they have migrated somewhere; others again are inclined to
believe that a portion of the native inhabitants are of lineal Maoric
descent. If this were the case, they must have considerably improved as
a race; for the people here are now extremely peaceful. Should you ever
visit Londinia in your travels again, you ought not to omit paying a
visit to the National Museum; there you will find two embalmed Maoris,
a male and a female, the former beautifully tatooed. You will see them
side by side with other embalmed specimens of the aboriginals, such as
New Hollanders, American Redskins, etc., all of whom have long become
extinct.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124"
name="pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the same apply to the inhabitants of all countries where
Europeans have settled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only to those that are situated beyond the tropics; for
the tropical regions, with the exception of the cooler mountain
districts, are in the long run unsuited to the Caucasian race. The
interior of Africa has still its original negro population; New Guinea
is still inhabited by the Papoos, and many other islands of tropical
clime are still occupied by the descendants of the ancient aboriginals,
although they are rather on the decrease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have those tribes that belong to the so-called inferior races
improved at all in civilization?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. With all of them progress is slow, extremely slow.
Some even hold the opinion that their progress is after all more
imaginary than real; that is to say, that it merely consists of their
aping some of the European manners and customs, and of these rarely the
best. Still I believe I have sufficient ground to admit that they too
are progressing, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span>only that their progress differs
essentially in its character from that of the Caucasian
races.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile we had reached so far the northern island of New Zealand
that I was able to see through the telescope, not only the mountain
tops but even the most densely populated districts.</p>
<p>Our fellow-passengers woke up one after the other, and Miss
Phantasia asked me would I stay at the same hotel with them at
Melbourne? &ldquo;We go to the <i>Old-England</i>,&rdquo; continued
she; &ldquo;we have already ordered our dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered of course that I could never too late part with such
excellent company.</p>
<p>Bacon called the steward, and gave orders for us to be put down near
Cape Maria van Diemen, from which a telegram should be sent to
Melbourne.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards we floated over New Zealand, and I was obliged to
confess that Bacon had not said too much of that country. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>Few
districts in this world have been so largely favoured by nature. The
large bays and gulfs were crowded with innumerable vessels apparently
belonging to all nations. Of cities, towns, and villages, there was no
end, and everything indicated the highest degree of prosperity.</p>
<p>Among the most conspicuous flags I noticed one very liberally
represented; it had twelve suns on a blue field. Not knowing what they
meant, I once more inquired of my guide: what country did they
represent?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the standard of the twelve united states of New
Holland, which together form a federate republic,&rdquo; answered
Bacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A republic!&rdquo; was my reply; &ldquo;I always thought that
New Holland belonged to the British crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such <i>was</i> the case,&rdquo; replied Bacon, &ldquo;<i>at
one time</i>; but the child has outgrown the mother. For ever so long
the New Hollanders manage their own affairs. They are, as you are
doubtless aware, of European descent. That is the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>great difference between New Holland and the
East Indian islands, which at one time were yours. We have therefore
parted on the very best of terms, and the only bond that still joins us
together is that of reciprocal commercial interests. The vast Southland
has become a powerful government; and if ever&mdash;improbable as it
is&mdash;civilization should migrate from Old Europe, it still would
know where to find a centre. You will soon become aware of this on our
landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were rapidly moving. New Zealand disappeared from our horizon,
and in opposite direction other districts seemed to emerge from the
sea. That was New Holland, <i>the</i> great Southland, the goal of our
voyage.</p>
<p>Every passenger began to look after his luggage. The long extensive
coastline lay before us. We were slowly and obliquely descending. The
objects on the surface of the earth grew in size and distinctness. It
was evident that we were approaching a large city. Melbourne it was. A
few moments <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>afterwards we heard a bustle and a kind of
confused noise, only to be compared with the unfurling of sails and the
untying of ropes. A violent shock followed, and&mdash;I woke up in my
arm-chair.</p>

original of these passages we refer the scholar to that admirable
letter of Bacon&rsquo;s, <i lang="la">De mirabile potestate artis et
naturae</i>, etc., which appeared first of all in the work of Claudius
Celestinus, <i lang="la">De his quae mundo mirabiliter eveniunt,
Lutetiae Parisiorum</i>, 1542. Bacon&rsquo;s description of a flying
machine, of which we read in the same document, shows, however, that he
too, in his philosophical visions, was apt to transgress the line of
the possibilities.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

of the nineteenth century the Saxon element had almost entirely
disappeared from the English tongue; even the most intelligible Norman
words had had to give way to the most miraculous novelties in the shape
of bad Greek and Latin compounds. At the revival of the genuine
national dialect all such abominable mongrels as <i>telegram</i>,
<i>bicycle</i>, <i>velocipede</i>, etc., were expelled from decent
conversation. A <i>telegram</i> became a <i>wire-message</i>; a
<i>bicycle</i> a <i>two-wheel</i>; a <i>velocipede</i> a
<i>swift-foot</i>; <i>post-mortem</i> examinations went by the name of
<i>after-death</i> examinations; and as the language gained in
nationality, the nation&rsquo;s mind grew in clearness. The change was
a change for the better.</p>

education, and not to deny it his children. The repeal of any law,
prohibitory or compulsory, can only prove this, that the people for
whom the measure was originally framed have risen in the scale of moral

be accounted for <i>negatively</i> by the &ldquo;poorness of our
pal&aelig;ontalogical collections,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;imperfectness
of the genealogical record.&rdquo; Bacon, though apparently familiar
with, and not averse to, Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution, does
not seem to follow the doctrine out in its application to the human
race. How many errors remain to be eradicated, even in minds of the

Lessing, but it is a decided fallacy, current even among literati, that
the absence of a certain word in a certain language indicates the
absence of the idea embodied in the word among the nations by whom that
language is spoken. This vulgar error, the prolific source of so many
idle boasts, and unjust charges, and national vanities, we have
endeavoured to refute in a paper on &ldquo;The Philosophy of Verbal
Monopoly,&rdquo; printed in the &ldquo;Transactions of the Devonshire

little do we know of a country so worth knowing, that we daily commit
ourselves by speaking of it as Holland. The kingdom of the
<i>Netherlands</i>, as now constituted, is divided into ten counties or
provinces, and two of these are respectively called North and South
Holland. The former is the territory here alluded to; it includes
neither Leiden, nor the Hague, nor Rotterdam. To speak of the
Netherlands as Holland, corresponds to calling England Devonshire or
Cheshire, and this particular terminology is the more amusing to the
natives because with them it is a shibboleth of vulgarity. There never
was a kingdom of <i>Holland</i>, except from 1806&ndash;1810, under
Napoleonic rule, when the Dutch had lost their independence through
that most dangerous scourge of nations, internal division.</p>

order to make this allusion to Rotterdam intelligible to our English
readers, we have to state a few facts. While Rotterdam has an excellent
harbour, Amsterdam has not. From time to time the citizens of the
latter city have devised all kinds of means whereby to remedy the
natural disadvantage under which they labour. There is no lack of petty
jealousies between the two great rival commercial cities of the
Netherlands, and hence the allusion of dramatic rejoicings in Rotterdam
at the misfortune of the competitor.</p>

Although most of these speculations on university education would
